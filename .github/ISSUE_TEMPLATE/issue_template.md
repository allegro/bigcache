**What is BigCache doing that it shouldn't?**



**Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example**

When asking a question about a problem caused by your code, you will get much better answers if you provide code we can use to reproduce the problem. That code should be...

* ...Minimal – Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
* ...Complete – Provide all parts needed to reproduce the problem
* ...Verifiable – Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem

For more information on how to provide an MCVE, please see the [Stack Overflow documentation](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).

- Version (git sha or release):
- OS (e.g. from `/etc/os-release` or winver.exe):
